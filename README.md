# PID-Control-Line-Follower-Using-Raspberry-PI
The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.The Raspberry Pi primarily uses Raspbian, a Debian-based Linux operating system.A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism (controller) commonly used in industrial control systems. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired set point and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (sometimes denoted P, I, and D respectively) which give their name to the controller type. We have interfaced both things and in the output we have had the fastest response in line follower and it follows line fast with maximum response time.
